## Interesting Code Snippet

### Hereâ€™s a part of the code that overrides the `toString` method:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "ID: " + id + ", ISBN: " + isbn + ", Title: \"" + title + "\"";
}
```

### The override lets us change how a Book object is shown as a string. By overriding this method, we can display important details like the ID, ISBN, and Title clearly. This makes it easier to read and understand what the Book object is, especially when we print it out.
